- ðŸ”­ My background is in Electrical Engineering with a specilization in communcations systems and digital signal processing. I have a passion for security & strive to develop a deep understanding of any technology I work with.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a lifelong learner working on improving my programming skills. I first learned C++ and C# over 10 years ago and have been working in Python and C more recently.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about selfhosting! I run a 5 node high-availability Proxmox cluster which houses all of my self-hosted applications, most of which are running in Docker. Check out my network diagram on my [website](https://litts.me/homelab)
- I have become fascinated with networking, and have spent a lot of time working on understanding the TCP/IP stack through implementation of a complex home network including OPNsense Firewalls, managed switches, DNS filtering, reverse proxies, network attached storage, and Docker application containers. 

Here's the (mostly) complete list of what I am running at home:
