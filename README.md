## $ whoami
- ðŸ”­ My background is in Electrical Engineering with a specilization in communcations systems and digital signal processing. I have a passion for security & strive to develop a deep understanding of any technology I work with.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a lifelong learner working on improving my programming skills. I first learned C++ and C# over 10 years ago and have been working in Python and C more recently.
- ðŸŒŽ Check out my [website](https://litts.me/homelab), where I post writeups about my projects and share my academic research
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about selfhosting! I run a 5 node high-availability Proxmox cluster which houses all of my self-hosted applications, most of which are running in Docker.
- ðŸ’» I use Linux everywhere I can!
- ðŸ“» Software Defined Radio (SDR) is one of the coolest technologies available! 
- ðŸ“¡ I am fascinated with networking, as it is at the core of all modern technology yet widely misunderstood! I have spent a lot of time working on understanding the TCP/IP stack through implementation of my own home network including OPNsense Firewalls, managed switches, DNS filtering, reverse proxies, network attached storage, and Docker application containers.
- I am learning more about automation and configuration management tools, including Terraform & Ansible, to streamline my testing/deployments with self-hosted Gitea Runners.
