## $ whoami
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a lifelong learner working on improving my programming skills. I first learned C++ and C# over 10 years ago and have been working in Go & Python more recently.
- ðŸŒŽ Check out my [website](https://litts.me/homelab), where I post writeups about my projects and share my research
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about selfhosting! I run a 5 node high-availability Proxmox cluster which houses all of my self-hosted applications, most of which are running in Docker.
- ðŸ’» I use Linux everywhere I can!
- I am learning more about automation and configuration management tools, including Terraform & Ansible, to streamline my testing/deployments with self-hosted Gitea Runners.
